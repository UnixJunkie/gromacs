 * \brief Declares the routine the describes whether GPU 3D FFT is
 * supported by this build configuration.
 *
 * At first glance, this method belongs in gpu_3dfft.h. But it is used
 * in high-level code that does not otherwise need to be compiled with
 * awareness of the GPU types that are used in that header. So it is
 * better to have a separate lightweight header for this.
