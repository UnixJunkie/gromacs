Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed gmxapi MD plugin binding
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Molecular Dynamics extension code was not properly handled when added to a
simulation through the gmxapi Python interface.
This meant that restraint potentials would silently fail to be applied with
gmxapi versions >= 0.1.
Updates have been applied internally to gmxapi.
Third party code should not need to be updated, but developers will
note an additional "null restraint" in
https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/tree/master/python_packaging/sample_restraint
(for illustration and testing purposes).

:issue:`4078`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
