Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check that necessary python modules are available
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The source code validation could otherwise fail a build with cryptic errors.

:issue:`3985`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removed performance loss in the mdrun domain decomposition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With 16 or more so-called PP MPI ranks, the domain decomposition
repartitioning could incur large performance overheads due to a sub-optimally
sized hash table. This has now been fixed.

:issue:`4054`

Fix file mode for temporary files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Those got created using the wrong umask before.

:issue:`4040`
