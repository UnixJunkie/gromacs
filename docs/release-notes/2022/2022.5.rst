GROMACS 2022.5 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2023. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since the
previous 2022.4 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2021.6 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix perturbed exclusion handling across PBC in small systems
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Systems with up to a few hundred atoms where molecules with excluded
perturbed atoms were split over periodic boundary conditions could
have double counted Coulomb and LJ-PME interactions over long distances.
This led to very large errors in the energy and forces with PME and
reaction-field, which likely did not go unnoticed. With a plain Coulomb
cut-off the error is small and might not be noticed.

:issue:`4665`

Add missing net charge term when running PME on a GPU
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When PME was running on a GPU, the term due to a net charge of the system was missing.
In normal runs this only changed the potential energy by a constant, which is usually
not relevant. In free-energy calculations where the net charge of the systen changes,
the would lead to incorrect dV/dlambda and Delta lambda values (but one should anyhow
avoid changing the net charge of a system with free-energy calculations).

:issue:`4668`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improve muParser detection and bumped internal version to v2.3.4
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Update internal muParser version that include all changes made by
us. Use muParser's CMake config to detect external muParser. Update
required version for external muParser to match the internal version.
