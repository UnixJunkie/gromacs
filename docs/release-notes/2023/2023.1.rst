This version was released on TODO, 2023. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since the
previous 2023 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2022.5 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The AWH metric could be incorrect for free-energy lambda dimensions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When different lambda components had different values for the same lambda
point index, the AWH metric used dH/dlambda as input that used
the derivative with respect to all lambda components. Note that this
only affected the metric, not the sampling nor the free energy values.

:issue:`4730`

Fix checkpointing of expanded ensemble simulations with domain decomposition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Expanded-ensemble simulations can now restart from a checkpoint when running
multiple PP ranks.

:issue:`4629`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix crash in ``gmx solvate`` when using solvent box in PDB format
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Now a PDB file can be passed to the ``-cs`` option in ``gmx solvate``.
In previous releases (since at least 2016) this lead to a segfault.

Fix creating index file from another index file
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``gmx make_ndx`` can again accept an index file alone as input, without associated structure file.

:issue:`4717`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed abnormal termination during ``gmx`` startup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

|Gromacs| made a call to ``std::filesystem::equivalent`` in a less than
perfectly robust manner. This caused ``gmx`` to stop execution
when linked against the (atypical) libc++ standard library when
the build directory no longer existed.

:issue:`4724`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Workaround for strange compiler behavior to improve SYCL bonded kernel performance
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For some SYCL targets (most notably, hipSYCL for AMD GPUs with ROCm 5.x),
a very inefficient code was generated for bonded kernels.
Now, bonded force calculation on GPU is expected to be up to 3 times faster.
