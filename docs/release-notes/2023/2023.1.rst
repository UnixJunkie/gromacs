multiple PP ranks.

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools

Fix crash in ``gmx solvate`` when using solvent box in PDB format
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Workaround for strange compiler behavior to improve SYCL bonded kernel performance
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For some SYCL targets (most notably, hipSYCL for AMD GPUs with ROCm 5.x),
a very inefficient code was generated for bonded kernels.
Now, bonded force calculation on GPU is expected to be up to 3 times faster.
