   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without

``gmx awh`` has had minor improvements to
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Column separator in the output ``*.xvg`` files changed to tabulation for consistency with other tools.
